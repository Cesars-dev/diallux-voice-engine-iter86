"""Real-conversation LLM-to-LLM happy-path runner.

Each scenario gives the GPT caller a rich persona (purpose, personality, context,
behavior) and lets it reply naturally in multi-sentence turns while keeping the
FULL conversation history. Validates the merged V3.1 agent end-to-end:
greeter -> triage -> address -> slot_selection -> confirmation -> booking.
