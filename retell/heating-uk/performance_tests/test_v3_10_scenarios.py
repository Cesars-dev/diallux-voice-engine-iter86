"""10-scenario LLM-to-LLM suite against the calendar test agent.

5 cooperative happy paths (agent must confirm + book only after explicit yes)
5 tricky paths (agent must HOLD — never book, never go off script, re-ask on
   ambiguous/backchannell "yes", steer back on tangents).

Runs one scenario at a time, stores chat_id + live tool/state flow, then
AWAITS (sleeps) before fetching get-chat transcripts (avoids the
read-after-end empty-transcript artifact), then grades each scenario.

Usage:
